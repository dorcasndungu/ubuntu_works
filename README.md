<h3>About Project</h3>

![ubuntu_works_screenshot](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/D4D22AQHVM8yFOe4XdQ/feedshare-shrink_2048_1536/0/1711901787742?e=1714608000&v=beta&t=dnDZoHTQFYYGeLM1s79MbpbfnPhzpjqHPHtzj7ezq88)

This is a website where people can write challenges they encounter, believing them amenable to software-based solutions.

<h3>Objective</h3>
* Users would be provided with an intuitive interface to articulate the challenges they face, accompanied by detailed descriptions and contextual information.
* The submission form could include fields for categorization, such as industry verticals (e.g., healthcare, education, finance) or specific problem domains (e.g., data management, automation, communication).
* Submitted challenges would undergo a curation process to ensure relevance and feasibility.
* A review system, possibly facilitated by community moderators or AI algorithms, would evaluate the merit and potential impact of each challenge.
* Developers within the Ubuntu community would browse through curated challenges and express interest in tackling specific ones.
* There can be integration with different platforms drive attention to popular problems and drive the development
* Integration with perhaps the issues system on GitHub or readme will work well for trucking progress.
* With enough drive a popular project would get its own platform on the website where is can be followed and tracked.
